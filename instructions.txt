All Stata .do files have been tested and run properly. 
There are three .do files for two tasks - stress-test and panel analysis.

Overall, data for all models comes from FRED and FFIED. The raw csv files are in folders data_bank and data_fred
but they are not necessary since they have been combined in six csv files: data_4, data_5, data_6, data_101, data_102 and data_103
based on codes of banks. 

Each of these csv files contains bank specific data as well as macroeconomic indicators.
These files are used to build panel regressions.

The stress testing exercise is based on data from FRED and aggregated banking data for all American banks coming from FFIEC.
These raw files are in folder NATIONAL which is in folder data_bank. However, all necessary data have been combined 



Task 1. Stress-testing resilience of national banking system

The stress-testing exercise is conducted using stress.do Stata file. The .do file runs smoothly once
the directory is updated. The stress.do and stress.xlsx files should be in the same directory. 
The macroeconomic scenarios for stress.do are coming from FED and are described in detail in report.
The bank specific data comes files in folder NATIONAL and they all have prefix nation_


Task 2. Panel regression analysis

To build panel, you will have to run Stata file individual_files.do. This file creates panel based on data_4.csv, ..., data_103.csv files.
It finally creates file panel.dta which is used by script modeling.do which estimates panel regressions. 
To build panel models for the first time, you will have to put files data_4.csv, ..., data_103.csv, individual_files.do and modeling.do 
in the same directory, update the directory adress in both .do files and then run individual_files.do and modeling.do in this order. 
If the file panel.dta already exists, you can just run modeling.do script.
